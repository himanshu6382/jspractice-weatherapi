# jspractice-weatherapi
What the app does:
* Takes a default location
* Makes a fetch call to the openweather.com api and gets the weather data in json
* Displays the relevant data in the UI
* Gives user the option to change the location (State applicable only for US)
* Saves the new location in browser storage for future reference

what I learnt

* Fetch
* Async/await/promises
* Application structuring
* Local browser storage
* html, bootstrap - modal
